# Machine-Learning
This repository contains implementation of Machine Learning techniques. The following approaches have been used - 

• Naive Bayes classifier on the mushroom dataset from the UCI directory - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom. The dataset contains 22 features and classifier was used to implement if the mushroom selected is edible or poisonous. The dataset contains total 8124 instances. 4000 instances have been used for training and the rest for testing. The accuracy achieved was 79.85% by removing the missing instances in the dataset.

• k-nearest neighbour classifier and regressor on iris dataset from the UCI directory -  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. The dataset contains 4 features and 150 instances with no missing values. The data was shuffled for the implementation of the technique and split 80% for training and 20% for testing.. The accuracy achieved for both the classification and regression was above 95%. The code implements both .csv(for classification) and .data(for regression) files
